# PATCH and DELETE with Fetch

### Goals
- Execute patch requests
- Execute delete requests

To use the mock-API:
First install JSON Server: `npm install -g json-server`
To start the server run `json-server --watch db.json`
This will produce the following endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/pokemons`

### Deliverables:
- Make a fetch request to persist number of likes update 
- Make a fetch request to delete selected pokemon
