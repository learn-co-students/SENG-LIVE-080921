# ES6 

### Goals
- Explain the difference between declaring arrow functions and regular functions
- Arrow functions improve readability especially when being used as callbacks, for ex: in iterators
- Use the spread operator to make copies of arrays and objects
- Destructure arrays and objects


To use the mock-API:
First install JSON Server: `npm install -g json-server`
To start the server run `json-server --watch db.json`
This will produce the following endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/pokemons`
